# Handling zero assignments to reference-typed targets

## Problem
The generated bytecode attempted to store primitive `0` values into reference-typed fields and locals. When the LPC torch object assigns zero to its string and mixed fields during `reset`, the compiler emitted `ICONST_0` directly before a `putfield`, producing an invalid operand stack and a `java.lang.VerifyError` during class loading:

```
Location:
  obj/torch.reset(Z)Ljava/lang/Object; @30: putfield
Reason:
  Type integer (current frame, stack[2]) is not assignable to 'java/lang/Object'
```

The problematic LPC code comes directly from `lpc2j.test.lpmud.obj.torch`:

```lpc
reset(arg) {
    if (arg)
        return;
    amount_of_fuel = 0; name = 0; is_lit = 0; weight = 0;
}
```

## Change
Assignments now adapt the emitted bytecode to the declared target type:

- When storing into `string` or object-typed fields/locals, a literal `0` is rewritten to `null` on the stack before the store.
- When storing primitive values into `mixed` targets, the compiler boxes the primitive (`Integer`, `Float`, or `Boolean`) so the JVM receives a reference instead of a raw primitive.
- The same coercions apply to field initializers emitted by constructors.

This keeps the operand stack type-safe for reference stores and mirrors LPC semantics where `0` doubles as `null` for reference types while still allowing primitives to live inside `mixed` slots.

## Examples
The following LPC snippets now compile into verifier-safe bytecode:

```lpc
// Clearing a string field with zero
string title;
void reset(int arg) {
    if (!arg) title = 0; // becomes a null store instead of an integer store
}
```

```lpc
// Storing an integer into a mixed field
mixed payload;
void set_payload(int value) {
    payload = value; // now boxed to Integer before hitting the mixed field
}
```

```lpc
// Boxing a boolean status into a mixed local
mixed flag;
void toggle(status enabled) {
    flag = enabled; // Boolean.valueOf is emitted
}
```

These adaptations prevent verifier errors while preserving the ability to use `0` as a falsy/null sentinel in LPC source.
